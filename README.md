Historical Parature ticket search based on Django and PostgreSQL.

## Development Setup

To turn on `DEBUG` in the settings, set the environment variable `DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT` to anything:

```bash
export DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT=True
```

This will cause the `DEBUG` variable set in `mysite/settings_dev.py` to override the value of it in `mysite/settings.py`.
